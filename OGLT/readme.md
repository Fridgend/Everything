# OGLT
OGLT, short for OpenGL Testing, is a project I made to start learning how to use OpenGL together with SDL2 in C++. I am following an amazing tutorial, that you can find here: https://learnopengl.com/.
This project's purpose was just to learn OpenGL since I am currently working on a game where I'd like to use SDL2 and OpenGL together.

## Challenges:
- The tutorial I have been following has been great and is very clear meaning very little error can occur. I haven't had any issues with code itself, but rather the version of OprnGL and GLSL I'm using. I was writing this project on my raspberry pi, but unfortunately, the raspberry pi doesn't seem to have access to the most recent versions, but rather a pretty old one. I'm currently in the process of moving to project over to a different computer and converting the project to run on windows where I can use the latest versions.

## Improvements to the future:
- Seeing as this is still just me learning a new concept, I can't imagine there's anything I could improve on as of right now.

## What I learned:
- So far, I would say I have developed a strong foundation in OpenGL.
- I now also have a deeper understanding of how graphics actually work in games.

# What is OpenGL and SDL2?
OpenGL and SDL2 are two libraries used in computer graphics, and in my case (and many others), game development. SDL2 runs on the CPU and can manage simpler textures, but if you really want to make something that looks good, OpenGL is usually included as it runs on the GPU and can generate higher quality. SDL2 and OpenGL are often used together, especially in game development.

### Written in...
This project was written entirely in C++ and some GLSL and CMake.
