# CHBot
This is a discord bot that I designed a few years back with the help of some popular YouTube tutorials. It started out as just me trying to learn the discord bot API using these tutorials, but as I became more confident, more and more of this project became my own work.
The discord bot was made for a discord server that is no longer active. It was made mainly to make the life of moderators easier, but also had a few features designed for the community.
