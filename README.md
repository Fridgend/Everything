# Everything
This is the repository where I keep all of my finished/WIP projects that I'd like to share with others. Keep in mind, that some of these projects are made on a Raspberry Pi and weren't made for sharing, so running the program could be difficult. All of the included libraries you will have to install and add to your path.

### Each project has a Readme file
The readme file explains the project simply.
