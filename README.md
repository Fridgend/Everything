# Everything
This is the repository where I keep all of my finished/WIP projects that I'd like to share with others. Keep in mind, that some of these projects are made on a Raspberry Pi and weren't made for sharing, so running the program could be difficult. All of the included libraries you will have to install and add to your path.

Also, just to clarify, this isn't all of my projects. I have quite a few more that I'd like to share, but they are currently not available to me since the computer they are stored on is currently not available to me and won't be for a few weeks. Those projects are mostly Python projects and a couple of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects. I guess I could quickly describe some that I remember from the top of my head: 
- A website that was supposed to be my portfolio, but I ended up disliking the idea and giving up on it (although I still have it and look at it sometimes).
- A Python program that would be a kind of building game where you could add components to this large system to build a nuclear power plant and they would all work together to generate electricity. I had the basics down but I just couldn't stand having to type in all of my commands in the terminal (that's how you would build and connect stuff), so I eventually got tired of it. I've been thinking about picking it up some time though, maybe I'll add an actual graphical user interface.

### Each project has a Readme file
The readme file explains the project simply.
