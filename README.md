# Everything
This is the repository where I keep all of my finished/WIP projects that I'd like to share with others. Keep in mind, that some of these projects are made on a Raspberry Pi and weren't made for sharing, so running the program could be difficult. All of the included libraries you will have to install and add to your path.

Also, just to clarify, this isn't all of my projects. I have quite a few more that I'd like to share, but they are currently not available to me since the computer they are stored on is currently not available to me and won't be for a few weeks. Those projects are mostly Python projects and a couple of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects.

### Each project has a Readme file
The readme file explains the project simply.
