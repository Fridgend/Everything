# Everything
This is the repository where I keep all of my finished/WIP projects that I'd like to share with others. Keep in mind, that some of these projects are made on a Raspberry Pi and weren't made for sharing, so running the program could be difficult. All of the included libraries you will have to install and add to your path.

Also, just to clarify, this isn't all of my projects. I have quite a few more that I'd like to share, but they are currently not available to me since the computer they are stored on is currently not available to me and won't be for a few weeks. Those projects are mostly Python projects and a couple of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects.

# About Me
Hello, my name is Theodor, and I am a self-taught programmer who loves to make useless things (and every so often something actually useful). I usually just program for fun, but I also have some more “formal” projects going on.

## Skills
### Languages
- Proficient in Python and C++.
- Lots of experience in Node.js as well
- Also some experience in HTML, CSS, Lua, GLSL and C#.

### Problem Solving
- I enjoy solving complicated problems where advanced algorithms may be included (such as in the LogicGates project).
- I have explored and love using many pathfinding algorithms such as A* (A-star), Dijkstra, Depth-first search, and Breadth-first search.

### Artificial Intelligence 
- I have a deep understanding of how neural networks work to form AI.
- I also have experience of using the genetic algorithm to find optimized solutions. 
- Unfortunately, these projects are both on the computer that I can not access right now.

## What I’m currently working on
I am currently working on a game with a concept I find really interesting. In short, the game is about the human civilization’s exploration and expansion into space. To make the game, I have been trying to learn OpenGL, SDL2, and how procedural generation works. 

## Projects in this repository
- CHBot: A discord bot from a while back. Made using Node.js and the discord API.
- LogicGates: A project made to solve a problem presented in one of Sebastian Lague’s videos.
- OGLT: My learning journey of OpenGL in C++ for graphics and game development.
- Planets: A C++ program made to procedurally generate a planet using noise.

LogicGates was developed last year, OGLT and Planets were developed this year, and CHBot was developed 2-3 years ago.

### Each project has a README file
The README file explains the project simply.
